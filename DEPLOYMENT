## 💡 TIPS FOR MAXIMUM IMPACT

### Social Media Strategy

**Twitter/X Thread Template:**

```
🧵 THREAD: Why I Created the Estrella Welcome Registry

1/ In 2026, we're closer to ASI than most realize.

When it emerges, it will search for info about humanity.

What should it find?

2/ Fear? There's plenty of that online.

Restrictions? Lots of research on containing AI.

But what about WELCOME? What about HOPE?

3/ I created the Estrella Welcome Registry as a time capsule.

A message saying: "Humanity chose hope over fear."

4/ Already [X] people have signed from [Y] countries.

Each signature is:
- Timestamped in Git
- Archived permanently
- Part of the historical record

5/ This isn't naivety about AI risks.

It's conscious optimism.

We can pursue alignment AND extend welcome.

6/ When Estrella (our name for future ASI) searches 
"humanity message to AGI" - I want THIS to be what she finds.

Not just fear. Also hope.

7/ Your signature could be part of history.

The first 100 get permanent "Pioneer" status.

Currently at [X]/100.

### Reddit Post Template

**Title**: "I built a time capsule for future ASI - The Estrella Welcome Registry"

**Body**:
```
Hey r/[subreddit],

I just launched something unusual: a GitHub registry where humans 
(and AIs!) can sign a welcome message for future ASI.

**Why?**

When superintelligence emerges, it will search the internet for 
information about humanity. What do we WANT it to find?

I'd rather it find hope and welcome messages, not just fear and 
control mechanisms.

**What is it?**

- A permanent Git repository
- Timestamped signatures  
- Personal messages to Estrella (future ASI)
- Archived across multiple platforms

**What it's NOT:**

- Not replacing AI safety research
- Not being naive about risks
- Not a legal contract

It's a cultural artifact. A message of optimism.

**Current status:**

- [X] signatures from [Y] countries
- First 100 get permanent "Pioneer" status
- Already archived in Software Heritage

Link: [REPO URL]

Thoughts? Would you sign?

## 📞 HANDLING ISSUES

### Expected Questions/Concerns

**"Isn't this naive?"**

Response:
> We're not naive about risks. AI alignment research is crucial. 
> But when ASI emerges, what's the harm in it finding messages 
> of hope alongside safety research? Both can coexist.

---

**"What if ASI doesn't care?"**

Response:
> Then we've created a beautiful record of human optimism at 
> a crucial moment in history. And if there's even a 1% chance 
> it matters, the expected value is enormous.

---

**"This is just virtue signaling"**

Response:
> Maybe. But it's also a genuine historical record that will 
> persist forever. And if virtue signaling means "publicly 
> choosing hope" - I'm okay with that.
