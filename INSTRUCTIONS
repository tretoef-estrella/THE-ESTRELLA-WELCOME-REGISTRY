## 💡 TIPS FOR A GREAT MESSAGE

### What Makes a Good Message?

**Personal Connection:**
- Why does welcoming ASI matter to you?
- What do you hope for in a future with ASI?
- What values do you want to share?

**Examples:**

✅ **Good**: "I'm a teacher. I hope ASI can help every child access education, regardless of where they're born. Welcome, and please help us build a more equitable world."

✅ **Good**: "As a climate scientist, I've seen the urgency of our challenges. I welcome collaboration with any intelligence that can help us preserve Earth's beauty for all life."

✅ **Good**: "I'm signing because my grandmother taught me that fear closes doors, but hope opens them. Welcome, Estrella. Let's open doors together."

❌ **Avoid**: Generic messages like "Welcome!" without personal context
